        <p>Hey there stranger, we are Pandamusic! We make sure that you are always up to date with the newest events related to music whilst still enjoying our cute page.
            We make sure you can buy tickets for the normal price, but we also provide pre-order tickets the moment we hear of the event. If the event cancels you will get a refund within 3 buisness days.
            You can always contact our staff if you experience any discomfort on our website or any event you attend. Our review system makes sure to tell you the pro's and cons of any event you attend.
        </p>
